# Jeremy Lucas

I'm a software engineer with over 8 years of professional experience in software development, but I've been programming/hacking for over 15 years as a hobby. In my professional roles as a software engineer, I've worked on everything from the frontend of web sites and mobile apps, to middle-tier web services and APIs, to backend data systems and infrastructure, to embedded applications both on bare metal and Linux-based microcontrollers. For more details on my most recent positions and experience, or for information about recent projects and publications, please refer to my website at https://jerluc.com
